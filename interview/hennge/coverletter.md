Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Software Engineer (Go) role opportunity at HENNGE. As an experienced software developer with a passion for new technology and fast learner, I believe I am an excellent fit for this position.

I have learned that "HENNGE one" is one of the star products which provides a cloud solution for cross-platform, such as "Single Sign-On". It agitates my curiosity, and I cannot help wondering the architecture behind the product. It might be adding a middleware layer to integrate the diverse APIs of different cloud service providers. It must be a super cool product.

I am a "learnaholic" at heart, always eager to expand my knowledge and skills, and I believe this mindset would allow me to contribute significantly to HENNGE's culture of continuous growth. Moreover, I am passionate about sharing my finding with team members periodically, as I firmly believe that sharing is the higher stage of learning according to Feynman's Law of Learning, and it is beneficial for the growth of a team.

In my previous roles, I have also gained valuable experience in cooperate with foreign colleagues. Transparency and effective communication is the key during the collaboration. In order to get a work-life balance job, I keep practising my English skill and I attended the IELTS test last year, getting B2 level. 

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss my qualifications and contribute to HENNGE's continued success.



Sincerely,
